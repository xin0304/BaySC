# BaySC: Bayesian Spatial Clustering via MRFC-MFM

BaySC is a Bayesian nonparametric spatial clustering method for spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data. It combines a **Markov Random Field Constrained Mixture of Finite Mixtures (MRFC-MFM)** model with Gibbs sampling to identify spatial domains while automatically determining the number of clusters.

## Method Overview

BaySC models pairwise cell-cell similarity matrices (derived from gene expression or multi-modal embeddings) using a block-structured Gaussian likelihood. Spatial coherence is enforced through a MRF prior on cluster labels, and the number of clusters is inferred via a MFM prior with Pochhammer-symbol-based $V_n$ coefficients.

**Key features:**
- Nonparametric: automatically determines K (number of clusters)
- Spatial-aware: MRF prior encourages spatially coherent domains
- Multi-modal: supports RNA-only, ATAC-only, and RNA+ATAC/Protein fusion
- Numba-accelerated Gibbs sampler for scalability

**Pipeline:**
1. Preprocessing: HVG selection, normalization, PCA/SVD embedding
2. Similarity: L2-normalize embedding, compute cosine similarity, apply Fisher's Z transform
3. Spatial neighbor matrix: distance-thresholded binary adjacency
4. MFM prior: precompute $V_n$ coefficients (Pochhammer formula)
5. Gibbs sampling: iteratively update cluster assignments, block-wise $\mu/\tau$ parameters
6. Posterior summary: Dahl's method for representative clustering selection
7. Model assessment: mDIC / WAIC for model quality
8. Evaluation: ARI, AMI, NMI, Homogeneity, Moran's I, spARI, Silhouette

```

Each dataset directory under `scripts/` contains exactly two files:
- **`preprocess.py`** -- raw data to embeddings
- **`run.py`** -- clustering with locked parameters, evaluation, and visualization

## Installation

Python 3.8 or later is recommended. From the project root, install the
dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The sampler can optionally use `numba-scipy` for its Numba-compatible
`gammaln` implementation. If it is unavailable, the original implementation
falls back to the approximation included in `src/core/sampler.py`.

## Usage

Raw data are not redistributed in this repository. Place the source files in
the paths listed in [DATA.md](DATA.md), then run the scripts from the project
root:

```bash
# Step 1: Preprocess (raw -> embeddings)
python scripts/breast_cancer/preprocess.py

# Step 2: Cluster + evaluate + visualize
python scripts/breast_cancer/run.py
```

All 12 datasets follow the same pattern:

```bash
python scripts/<dataset>/preprocess.py
python scripts/<dataset>/run.py
```

Where `<dataset>` is one of: `breast_cancer`, `her2_breast_a1`, `her2_breast_b1`, `her2_breast_c1`, `her2_breast_d1`, `her2_breast_e1`, `her2_breast_f1`, `her2_breast_g2`, `her2_breast_h1`, `starmap`, `misar_brain`, `human_lymph_node`.

To verify the installation without downloading a real dataset, run:

```bash
python tests/smoke_test.py
```

The simulation datasets can be regenerated without downloading external data:

```bash
python -m simulations.generate simulation1
python -m simulations.generate simulation2
python -m simulations.generate simulation3
```

See [`simulations/README.md`](simulations/README.md) for the fixed conditions,
random seeds, and generated file format.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **ARI** (Adjusted Rand Index): overall clustering agreement with ground truth
- **AMI** (Adjusted Mutual Information): information-theoretic agreement
- **NMI** (Normalized Mutual Information): normalized variant of MI
- **Homogeneity**: each cluster contains only members of a single class
- **Moran's I**: spatial autocorrelation of cluster labels
- **spARI**: spatially-aware ARI (penalizes spatially incoherent misassignments less)
- **Silhouette**: embedding-space cluster compactness and separation
- **mDIC**: modified Deviance Information Criterion for model quality

## Reproducibility

All results are deterministic given the same seed. Verified on Breast Cancer (Dahl's method):

```
Params: lam=28.0, th=700.0, t0=8.0, gamma=7.0, iter=100, burn_in=50, seed=42
K=20, ARI=0.5541, AMI=0.6663, NMI=0.6722, Homo=0.6928,
MoranI=0.7327, spARI=0.6643, Sil=0.0443
```

The committed files under `outputs/` contain the domain assignments from the
reported runs. Random seeds and dataset-specific analysis settings are defined
near the beginning of each `scripts/<dataset>/run.py` file.
